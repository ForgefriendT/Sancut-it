# 🌞Sankranti CIRCLE

## A Digital Sankranti Ritual

---

## 1. PROJECT ESSENCE (READ THIS FIRST)

Uttarayan Circle is **not a website and not a game**.
It is a **digital ritual** designed to be experienced calmly by people of all ages during Makarsankranti.

The goal is to feel:

* Peaceful
* Warm
* Thoughtful
* Culturally grounded

The design must look like it was created by a **professional graphic designer** — minimal, intentional, balanced, and emotionally intelligent.

There should be **nothing flashy, noisy, or trendy**.
Every animation, color, and sound must feel *earned*.

---

## 2. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Keywords

* Quiet luxury
* Soft minimalism
* Indian warmth
* Breathing space
* Human-first

### What this is NOT

* ❌ A tech demo
* ❌ A festival game
* ❌ A social media product
* ❌ A loud celebration

### What this IS

* ✅ A shared Sankranti moment
* ✅ A reflective space
* ✅ A modern cultural observance

---

## 3. VISUAL LANGUAGE

### Color Palette (Muted & Premium)

Use **soft, low-saturation colors only**.

Primary Sky Colors:

* Morning Blue: #CFE6F3
* Noon Sky: #EAF6FF
* Evening Gold: #F6D7A7
* Sunset Orange: #E8A87C

Accent Colors:

* Kite Red: #C94A4A
* Leaf Green: #6B8E6E
* Thread Gold: #C8A951

Neutral:

* Warm White: #FAF9F6
* Soft Charcoal: #3A3A3A

No pure black. No neon. No harsh contrast.

---

## 4. TYPOGRAPHY (DESIGNER-LEVEL)

### Primary Typeface

* Serif with warmth (example: Playfair-style or Indian serif)
* Used only for headings and quotes

### Secondary Typeface

* Clean humanist sans-serif (example: Inter / Source Sans style)
* Used for UI text

### Typography Rules

* Large line height
* Generous spacing
* Never center long paragraphs
* Text should feel *airy*

Example scale:

* Title: 36–42px
* Prompt text: 22–26px
* UI labels: 14–16px

---

## 5. LAYOUT STRUCTURE (ONE SCREEN EXPERIENCE)

### Overall Layout

* Single-screen, no scrolling by default
* Large sky canvas takes 70% height
* Soft UI layer floating on top

### Composition Rules

* Everything must be **centered vertically but not crowded**
* Use negative space intentionally
* UI elements should feel like they are *resting* in the sky

---

## 6. USER FLOW (SIMPLE & RESPECTFUL)

### Step 1: Arrival

User sees:

* Calm sky
* Slowly moving clouds
* A subtle line of text:

  > “Makarsankranti is a moment of turning.”

A single button:
**“Enter the Circle”**

No instructions overload.

---

### Step 2: The Prompt

Only **one question** appears at a time.

Examples:

* “What are you ready to let go of?”
* “What do you wish becomes sweeter this year?”
* “What freedom are you seeking?”

Prompt text is large and centered.

Below it:

* A single input field
* Character limit: 120

---

### Step 3: Transformation Moment (MOST IMPORTANT)

When user submits:

* Input gently fades
* Wind sound rises slightly
* A kite forms slowly
* The text dissolves into the kite’s motion

No sudden movement.
No pop sounds.

This moment should feel **ceremonial**.

---

## 7. THE LIVING SKY SYSTEM

### Kite Design

* Flat, minimal shapes
* Soft fabric texture
* Slight imperfections (handmade feel)

Each kite:

* Color influenced by emotion
* Movement influenced by intent

### Emotional Wind Logic (Invisible)

* Gratitude → steady wind
* Letting go → upward drift
* Hope → gentle forward motion

Do NOT explain this to users.

---

## 8. TIME-BASED SKY

Sky color changes based on real time:

* Morning: cool, hopeful
* Afternoon: open and bright
* Evening: warm and reflective

At night:

> “The sun rests, but intentions remain.”

---

## 9. COLLECTIVE MOMENTS

Every 25 submissions:

* Motion slows
* One soft bell sound
* 3-second pause

This creates a **shared silence**.

No notification text.
Just the moment.

---

## 10. SWEETNESS METER (VERY SUBTLE)

Small corner text:

> “Sweetness shared today”

Displayed as:

* A slowly filling soft bar
* Or a glowing dot

No numbers. No gamification.

---

## 11. REFLECTION MODE (OPTIONAL & HIDDEN)

After participation, a small icon appears.

Tapping it shows:

* 3 anonymous kites
* Their thoughts

No reactions. No replies.
Just reading.

---

## 12. END-OF-DAY SCROLL

At sunset only:

A single overlay appears once:

> “Today, 142 thoughts were released.
> The sky was most peaceful at 6:18 PM.”

It fades automatically.

---

## 13. SOUND DESIGN

* Wind (very soft)
* Occasional bell
* No music loop
* Volume must be low enough to allow conversation

Sound must feel **environmental**, not musical.

---

## 14. TECH GUIDELINES

* HTML5 + CSS3
* JavaScript
* Canvas or SVG for sky
* Smooth easing functions
* 60fps target
* Offline-friendly if possible

Performance > effects.

---

## 15. FINAL FEELING CHECK

Before finishing, ask:

* Does this feel calm?
* Would an elder feel comfortable using it?
* Does it respect Sankranti?
* Does it feel designed, not engineered?

If yes — it’s correct.

---

## 16. FINAL LINE (DO NOT REMOVE)

> “Uttarayan Circle is not meant to impress.
> It is meant to be felt.”
